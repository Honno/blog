title:      Simplify data binning with a custom dict
summary:    A smart container that groups observations around central interval values.
categories: python datasci
---

In data science one often needs to bin continuous data together
to generalise noisy observations.
Histograms are the prime example of data binning,
allowing you to quickly identify patterns in data.

The particulars of how one groups these bins can vary.
For the cases when you're just using central values to be ceiled/floored to,
I've come up with an elegant and performative solution
using Python's container data model.

Containers are the objects that store stuff and use the square brackets `[]` notation for access:

* Elements of a list `my_list` can be accessed and modified
via an index `i` with a `my_list[i]` statement.

* Values of a dictionary `my_dict` can be accessed and mofied
via a key `k` with a `my_dict[k]` statement.

I've created a custom container type `Bins` to abstract data bins.
Elements of the data bins `my_bins` can be accessed and modified
via _any_ real number `n` with a `my_bins[n]`.
If `n` is not an actual key of `my_bins`,
then it will be rounded to closest actual key.

`Bins` is initialised with the desired intervals.
Each interval is essentially a key paired up with a count,
where the count starts at 0.

```python
>>> bins = Bins([-6, -3, 0, 3, 6])
>>> bins
{-6: 0, -3: 0, 0: 0, 3: 0, 6: 0}
>>> bins[3] += 1                    # n = 3
>>> bins
{-6: 0, -3: 0, 0: 0, 3: 1, 6: 0}
>>> bins[7] += 1                    # n = 6
>>> bins[11] += 1                   # n = 6
>>> bins[6.5] += 1                  # n = 6
>>> bins
{-6: 0, -3: 0, 0: 0, 3: 1, 6: 3}
>>> bins[-1000000] += 1             # n = -6
>>> bins
{-6: 1, -3: 0, 0: 0, 3: 1, 6: 3}
>>> bins[0.5] += 1                  # n = 0
>>> bins
{-6: 1, -3: 0, 0: 1, 3: 1, 6: 3}
```

As you can see, this feels an awful lot like a dictionary
---infact, `Bins` inherits the abstract base class [`MutableMapping`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.abc.html#collections.abc.MutableMapping)
to mirror the interface one would expect from a `dict`.
A minimal subclass would require the following methods to be overridden.

```python
class Bins(MutableMapping):
    def __init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        ...

    def __getitem__(self, key):
        ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        ...

    def __delitem__(self, key):
        ...

    def __iter__(self):
        ...
    
    def __len__(self):
        ...
```

First we want to initialise `Bins` with the the desired intervals.
We can can store this as in an internal dict
that will hold the contents of `Bins`.

```python
    def __init__(self, intervals):
        empty_bins = {interval: 0 for interval in intervals}
        self._dict = empty_bins
```

The `__getitem__()` and `__setitem__()` methods
define the behaviour of using
the square brackets `[]` notation.
We want to intersect `key` and round it to the closest interval,
before applying a valid key (an interval) to our internal dictionary.

```python
    def __getitem__(self, key):
        interval = self._roundkey(key)
        return self._dict[interval]

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        interval = self._roundkey(key)
        self._dict[interval] = value
        
    def _roundkey(self, key):
        intervals = list(self._dict.keys())
        minkey = intervals[0]
        midkeys = intervals[1:-1]
        maxkey = intervals[-1]

        if key <= minkey:
            return minkey
        elif key >= maxkey:
            return maxkey
        elif key in midkeys:
            return key
        else:
            i = bisect_left(intervals, key)
            leftkey = intervals[i - 1]
            rightkey = intervals[i]

            if abs(leftkey - key) < abs(rightkey - key):
                return leftkey
            else:
                return rightkey
```

As you can see,
the method `_roundkey()` rounds the `key` to the closest interval.
We check whether `key` is an actual interval first,
before using Python's [`bisect_left`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/bisect.html#bisect.bisect_left)
to find the ceil and floor intervals relative to `key`
and return the nearest one.

And what do we have to do to get inplace operators such as `+=` working?
Nothing!
All they're doing is retrieving a value from the passed key via `__getitem__()`,
applying an operation to value,
and assigning the new value to the key via `__setitem__()`.

So if you just have `__delitem__()`, `__iter__()` and `__len__()`
directly interface with `self._dict`,
you'll have a working `Bins` of your own!

## Production readiness

But I'm not quite happy with this yet.
First of, if we passed intervals which are out-of-order,
then we completely screw up how `_roundkey()` works
in finding the closest interval.
We _can_ just sort the intervals ourselves at initialisation.

```python
    def __init__(self, intervals):
        empty_bins = {interval: 0 for interval in sorted(intervals)}
        self._dict = empty_bins
```

Before Python 3.7 this wouldn't be ideal as
dictionaries did not guarantee insertion order.
They do now, however we can still end up with an unordered `self._dict`
if someone used the [`update()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html?highlight=update#dict.update) method.
I can't forsee a situation someone would want to do this,
but `update()` is used in data serialisation and anywho is exposed by `MutableMapping`,
so it's a good idea to update our internal dictionary's order as well.

Thankfully we have Python's [`OrderedDict`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/collections.html#collections.OrderedDict)
which will guantee the dictionary's keys will always be sorted.

```python
    def __init__(self, intervals):
        empty_bins = {interval: 0 for interval in intervals}
        self._odict = OrderedDict(empty_bins)
```

We can also cache the `_roundkey()` result of frequently passed keys.
I found in some situations I was using `Bins` in an algorithm
that this could drastically improve performance,
as rounding a `float`-type key to an interval
is a bit expensive
but the exact same key is being passed regularly.

Python's [`@lru_cache()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functools.html#functools.lru_cache)
decorator makes this simple to implement.
You can just pop it on a function with hashable arguments,
and it will use a [LRU cache](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_replacement_policies#Least_recently_used_(LRU))
to store the results of frequent function calls

As the act of rounding keys is only interested in the _intervals_ of `Bins`,
I created a util method (i.e. instance-agnostic)
which takes only the intervals and passed key
to find the closest interval,
which is conveniently wrapped by `_roundkey()`.

```python
class Bins(MutableMapping):
    ...
    @property
    def intervals(self):
        return tuple(self._odict.keys())

    def _roundkey(self, key):
        return find_closest_interval(self.intervals, key)
    ...

@lru_cache()
def find_closest_interval(intervals, key):
    minkey = intervals[0]
    midkeys = intervals[1:-1]
    maxkey = intervals[-1]

    if key <= minkey:
        return minkey
    elif key >= maxkey:
        return maxkey
    elif key in midkeys:
        return key
    else:
        i = bisect_left(intervals, key)
        leftkey = intervals[i - 1]
        rightkey = intervals[i]

        if abs(leftkey - key) < abs(rightkey - key):
            return leftkey
        else:
            return rightkey
```

## Fin

I hope you've learnt a thing or two today,
and maybe even have a new tool in your data science workbench.

I've exposed the `Bins` implementation I've been using in my
randomness testing library [coinflip](https://github.com/Honno/coinflip/),
available in the [`coinflip.collections.Bins`](https://coinflip.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/collections.html)
namespace.
I believe it's production ready,
but possibly there are quirks I have yet to encounter and test for!
The source code is available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/Honno/coinflip/blob/main/src/coinflip/_randtests/common/collections.py#L17)
([tests](https://github.com/Honno/coinflip/blob/main/tests/collections/test_bins.py) too).

A really cool project would be implementing interval ranges
so that binning doesn't have to rely on "central values".
This could be achieved very nicely with [slices](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#slice)
(e.g. the `obj[a:b:c]` syntax)
---this is not unprecedented as [pandas](pandas.pydata.org/) uses slices for
expressing operations quite nicely.

For any Raymond Hettinger fans out there,
you'll know that every trick and tool I'm using here
was heavily influenced by him.
Thanks also to redditor ElevenPhonons for giving me some great feedback!
